Literature review on options overlay strategies, volatility risk premium, and tail risk hedging.

## 1. Protective Put Overlays

- **Israelov (2017)** — "Pathetic Protection: The Elusive Benefits of Protective Puts." *J. Alternative Investments*. Put options are ineffective at reducing drawdowns vs simply reducing equity exposure. Unless timing is perfect around drawdowns, puts increase volatility per unit of expected return. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2934538)

- **Israelov & Nielsen (2015)** — "Still Not Cheap: Portfolio Protection in Calm Markets." *J. Portfolio Management*, Vol. 41, No. 4. The volatility risk premium (implied > realized vol), not absolute VIX level, determines whether puts are cheap. Even with low VIX, puts remain expensive relative to expected payout. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2579232)

- **Figlewski, Chidambaran & Kaplan (1993)** — "Evaluating the Performance of the Protective Put Strategy." *Financial Analysts Journal*, Vol. 49, No. 4. Early rigorous evaluation: some put strategies provide very little protection; ITM options produce more attractive profiles. [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v49.n4.46)

- **Cambridge Associates (~2020)** — "Portfolio Protection: Challenges with Equity Put Options." Systematic put buying eroded ~2/3 of equity returns over 30 years, delivering 35% of market return for 75% of market risk.

## 2. Covered Call / Call Overlay Strategies

- **Whaley (2002)** — "Return and Risk of CBOE Buy Write Monthly Index." *J. Derivatives*, Vol. 10, No. 2. Foundational BXM paper: passive covered calls on S&P 500 produced comparable returns with ~2/3 the volatility (1988-2001). [Link](https://jod.iijournals.com/content/10/2/35)

- **Feldman & Roy, Ibbotson Associates (2005)** — "Passive Options-Based Investment Strategies: The Case of the CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index." *J. Investing*, Vol. 14, No. 2. BXM compound annual return 12.39% vs S&P 500 12.20%, with significantly lower volatility. [Link](https://joi.pm-research.com/content/14/2/66)

- **Neuberger Berman** — "Index Option Writing Strategy Benchmarks." Over 29.5 years, BXMD (10.66%) and PUT (10.13%) had highest annualized returns. PUT outperformed BXM by ~1%/yr. First three option-selling indices all beat S&P 500 on risk-adjusted basis. [PDF](https://www.nb.com/documents/public/global/wp_index_option_writing_strategy_benchmarks.pdf)

- **Israelov & Tummala (2017)** — "Which Index Options Should You Sell?" Buying S&P 500 options is only consistently profitable in the highest decile of volatility changes. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2990542)

## 3. Volatility Strategies (Straddles, Strangles)

- **Carr & Wu (2009)** — "Variance Risk Premiums." *Review of Financial Studies*, Vol. 22, No. 3. Theoretical foundation: variance risk premium is consistently negative (implied > realized), more negative for high-beta stocks. [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/22/3/1311/1581057)

- **Bakshi & Kapadia (2003)** — "Delta-Hedged Gains and the Negative Market Volatility Risk Premium." *Review of Financial Studies*, Vol. 16, No. 2. Direct evidence of negative volatility risk premium using S&P 500 options. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=267106)

- **Bondarenko (2014)** — "Why Are Put Options So Expensive?" *Quarterly J. Finance*, Vol. 4, No. 3. The "overpriced puts puzzle" — no standard model explains S&P 500 put prices. The volatility risk premium is a genuine market phenomenon. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=375784)

- **Berman, RiverPark (2014)** — "The Benefits of Systematically Selling Volatility." Over 24 years, systematic short strangle returned 15.2% compounded vs 9.9% for S&P 500 — 5.3%/yr of "structural alpha." [PDF](https://www.riverparkfunds.com/assets/pdfs/news/Structural_Alpha_White_Paper_Final.pdf)

- **Campasano (2020)** — "Portfolio Strategies for Volatility Investing." Examines portfolio strategies including straddles, strangles, condors, and VIX futures for harvesting the variance risk premium. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3490978)

## 4. VIX / Macro Signal Timing

- **Fassas & Hourvouliades (2019)** — "VIX Futures as a Market Timing Indicator." *J. Risk and Financial Management*. VIX term structure works as a contrarian market timing indicator. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3189502)

- **Simon & Campasano (2014)** — "The VIX Futures Basis: Evidence and Trading Strategies." *J. Derivatives*, Vol. 21, No. 3. Shorting VIX futures in contango, buying in backwardation = highly profitable. The VIX basis reflects a harvestable risk premium. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2094510)

## 5. Tail Risk Hedging (Universa / Taleb)

- **Ilmanen & Israelov, AQR (2018)** — "Chasing Your Own Tail (Risk)." Cost of tail hedging via OTM puts systematically exceeds benefits. Diversification across asset classes is more cost-effective. [AQR PDF](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/White-Papers/AQR-Chasing-Your-Own-Tail-Risk.pdf)

- **Bhansali & Davis, PIMCO (2010)** — "Offensive Risk Management: Can Tail Risk Hedging Be Profitable?" Challenges the view that tail hedging is inherently expensive. Actively managed tail-risk hedges can be profitable. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1573760)

- **Spitznagel, Universa (2021)** — "Safe Haven: Investing for Financial Storms." A 3.3% allocation to deep OTM puts with rest in S&P 500 produced 12.3% CAGR over 10 years, exceeding S&P 500 alone. Universa returned 3,612% in March 2020.

## 6. Collars

- **Israelov & Klein (2015)** — "Risk and Return of Equity Index Collar Strategies." Collars reduce equity premium capture without providing "free" protection. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2704718)

- **Braun, Hoffstein, Israelov & Nze Ndong (2023)** — "The Hidden Cost in Costless Put-Spread Collars: Rebalance Timing Luck." Tracking error between implementations varying only in rebalance date exceeds 400bps annualized. [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4336419)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Volatility risk premium is real and persistent** — implied vol consistently exceeds realized vol, making systematic option selling profitable on average.
2. **Covered calls / put-writing beat S&P 500 on risk-adjusted basis** — BXM/PUT indices deliver comparable returns with 30-35% less volatility.
3. **Protective puts are generally a drag** — systematic put buying erodes returns due to the VRP working against the buyer.
4. **Tail hedging is deeply debated** — AQR says diversify instead; Universa says small deep-OTM allocations can enhance compounding.
5. **VIX signals have genuine predictive power** — term structure, contango/backwardation, and relative levels provide actionable signals.
